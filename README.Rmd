## Overview

**urogynScorer** provides functions for scoring validated patient-reported outcome measures used in urogynecology clinical practice and research. The package implements evidence-based scoring algorithms with comprehensive validation and error handling for:

- **Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20)** and its subscales:
  - Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory (POPDI-6)
  - Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory (CRADI-8)
  - Urinary Distress Inventory (UDI-6)
- **Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I)**
- **Sandvik Severity Index** for urinary incontinence

## Installation

### CRAN version (recommended)
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("urogynScorer")
```

### Development version
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Install devtools if you haven't already
install.packages("devtools")

# Install the development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("mufflyt/urogynScorer")
```

## Key Features

- **Automated, standardized scoring** following validated methodologies
- **Robust handling of missing data** following instrument-specific guidelines
- **Comprehensive input validation** with informative error messages
- **Detailed logging** capabilities for quality assurance and debugging
- **Elegant handling of alternative column naming conventions**
- **Tidy output** compatible with the tidyverse ecosystem
- **Extensive documentation** with examples and references to primary literature

## Usage Examples

### Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20) Scoring

The Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20) measures pelvic floor symptoms across three domains:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(urogynScorer)
library(dplyr)

# Load sample data
data("pfdi_data_minimal")

# View first few rows
head(pfdi_data_minimal)

# Score PFDI-20
pfdi_results <- calculate_pfdi_scores(
  patient_data = pfdi_data_minimal,
  id_column = "Record_ID",
  missing_threshold = 0.5,  # Allow up to 50% missing data per subscale
  verbose = TRUE            # Enable detailed logging
)

# View results
pfdi_results
```

### Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I)

The PGI-I assesses patient-reported improvement following treatment on a 7-point scale:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Create sample data
pgii_data <- data.frame(
  Record_ID = c("PT001", "PT002", "PT003", "PT004", "PT005"),
  pgii_response = c(1, 2, 3, 4, NA)  # 1=Very much better, 7=Very much worse
)

# Score PGI-I responses
pgii_results <- score_pgii(
  patient_data = pgii_data,
  item_name = "pgii_response",
  keep_n_valid = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)

# View results
pgii_results
```

### Sandvik Severity Index

The Sandvik index categorizes urinary incontinence severity based on frequency and amount of leakage:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Create sample data
sandvik_data <- tibble::tibble(
  frequency = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 0),  # 0=Never to 4=Daily
  amount = c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1)      # 1=Drops to 3=Large amounts
)

# Calculate Sandvik Severity Index
sandvik_results <- sandvik_severity_index(
  frequency = sandvik_data$frequency,
  amount = sandvik_data$amount
)

# View results
sandvik_results
```

## How Questionnaires Are Scored

### PFDI-20 Scoring

The PFDI-20 consists of three subscales:

| Subscale | Questions | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **POPDI-6** | 1-6 | Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory |
| **CRADI-8** | 7-14 | Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory |
| **UDI-6** | 15-20 | Urinary Distress Inventory |

Each question uses a 0-4 scale:

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 0 | Not at all |
| 1 | Somewhat |
| 2 | Moderately |
| 3 | Quite a bit |
| 4 | Extremely |

**Scoring process:**
1. Calculate the mean score for each subscale (if ≥50% of items are answered)
2. Multiply the mean by 25 to get a 0-100 scale
3. Sum the three subscale scores to get the PFDI-20 total (0-300 scale)

### PGI-I Scoring

The PGI-I is scored from 1-7:

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Very much better |
| 2 | Much better |
| 3 | A little better |
| 4 | No change |
| 5 | A little worse |
| 6 | Much worse |
| 7 | Very much worse |

The `score_pgii()` function also adds a binary improvement indicator (1=improved [1-3], 0=not improved [4-7]).

### Sandvik Severity Index

The index is calculated by multiplying frequency (0-4) by amount (1-3) of leakage, resulting in:

| Severity Level | Score Range |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Slight**     | ≤1          |
| **Moderate**   | 2-5         |
| **Severe**     | 6-9         |
| **Very Severe**| ≥10         |

## Mathematical Basis for Scoring

### PFDI-20 Scoring Algorithm

The PFDI-20 consists of three subscales: POPDI-6 (questions 1-6), CRADI-8 (questions 7-14), and UDI-6 (questions 15-20).

For a given subscale with $n$ questions, where $q_i$ represents the response to question $i$ (ranging from 0 to 4):

1. Calculate the mean score $\bar{q}$ for each subscale if at least $p\%$ of the items are answered:

$$\bar{q} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} q_i}{n_{\text{valid}}}$$

where $n_{\text{valid}}$ is the number of non-missing responses, and $p$ is the threshold (by default, $p = 50\%$).

2. Scale the mean to get a 0-100 score for each subscale:

$$\text{Subscale Score} = 25 \times \bar{q}$$

3. Calculate the PFDI-20 total score by summing the three subscale scores:

$$\text{PFDI-20 Total} = \text{POPDI-6} + \text{CRADI-8} + \text{UDI-6}$$

The resulting PFDI-20 total score ranges from 0 to 300, with higher scores indicating greater distress.

### PGI-I Scoring

The PGI-I is scored directly on a 7-point scale:

$$\text{PGI-I Score} = r$$

where $r$ is the patient's response (1-7).

In addition, a binary improvement indicator is calculated:

$$\text{Improved} = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } r \in \{1, 2, 3\} \\
0 & \text{if } r \in \{4, 5, 6, 7\}
\end{cases}$$

### Sandvik Severity Index

The Sandvik Severity Index ($S$) is calculated by multiplying the frequency ($f$) and amount ($a$) of leakage:

$$S = f \times a$$

where:
- $f$ ranges from 0 (never) to 4 (daily)
- $a$ ranges from 1 (drops) to 3 (large amounts)

The resulting severity index is categorized as:

$$\text{Severity Category} = 
\begin{cases} 
\text{Slight} & \text{if } S \leq 1 \\
\text{Moderate} & \text{if } 2 \leq S \leq 5 \\
\text{Severe} & \text{if } 6 \leq S \leq 9 \\
\text{Very Severe} & \text{if } S \geq 10
\end{cases}$$
