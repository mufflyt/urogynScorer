ADDITIONAL NOTICES:

This package, urogynScorer, implements scoring algorithms for validated clinical
questionnaires and assessment tools. These implementations are based on published
research and validation studies, specifically:

1. The Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20) scoring algorithm is based on:
   Barber, M. D., Walters, M. D., & Bump, R. C. (2005). Short forms of two
   condition-specific quality-of-life questionnaires for women with pelvic
   floor disorders (PFDI-20 and PFIQ-7). American Journal of Obstetrics and
   Gynecology, 193(1), 103-113.

2. The Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scoring is based on:
   Yalcin, I., & Bump, R. C. (2003). Validation of two global impression
   questionnaires for incontinence. American Journal of Obstetrics and
   Gynecology, 189(1), 98-101.

3. The Sandvik Severity Index scoring is based on:
   Sandvik, H., Seim, A., Vanvik, A., & Hunskaar, S. (2000). A severity index
   for epidemiological surveys of female urinary incontinence: Comparison with
   48-hour pad-weighing tests. Neurourology and Urodynamics, 19(2), 137-145.

The algorithms implemented in this software are not endorsed by the original
authors of these instruments unless explicitly stated. Use of these scoring
algorithms in clinical or research settings should follow appropriate professional
standards and ethical guidelines.
