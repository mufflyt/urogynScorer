\description{
This dataset contains responses to the \strong{Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20)},
a validated questionnaire used in urogynecology to assess symptoms related to pelvic
organ prolapse, colorectal distress, and urinary distress. It includes responses
from a urogynecology patient cohort.

A dataset containing simulated responses to the PFDI-20 questionnaire
for demonstration purposes.
}
\details{
The \strong{Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20)} is composed of three subscales:
\itemize{
\item \strong{POPDI-6}: Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory (6 items)
\item \strong{CRADI-8}: Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory (8 items)
\item \strong{UDI-6}: Urinary Distress Inventory (6 items)
}

Each item is scored on a \strong{Likert scale from 0 to 4}, where:
\itemize{
\item 0 = Not at all
\item 1 = Somewhat
\item 2 = Moderately
\item 3 = Quite a bit
\item 4 = Greatly
}

The final score is computed using the \strong{score_pfdi()} function in the \code{urogynScorer} package.
