\title{Sandvik Severity Index Calculation}
\usage{
sandvik_severity_index(frequency, amount)
}
\arguments{
\item{frequency}{Numeric vector with values between 0 and 4 representing the frequency
of incontinence episodes.
\itemize{
\item 0: Never
\item 1: Less than once a month
\item 2: A few times a month
\item 3: A few times a week
\item 4: Every day and/or night
}}

\item{amount}{Numeric vector with values between 1 and 3 representing the amount of leakage.
\itemize{
\item 1: Drops
\item 2: Small amounts
\item 3: Large amounts
}}
}
\value{
A tibble with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Frequency} - The input frequency of incontinence.
\item \strong{Amount} - The input amount of leakage.
\item \strong{Severity_Index} - The computed Sandvik Severity Index (Frequency * Amount).
\item \strong{Severity_Level} - The categorized severity level:
\itemize{
\item "Slight" (≤ 1)
\item "Moderate" (2-5)
\item "Severe" (6-9)
\item "Very Severe" (≥ 10)
}
}
}
\description{
Computes the Sandvik Severity Index for urinary incontinence severity
based on frequency and amount of leakage.

\examples{
# Example data
example_data <- tibble::tibble(
  frequency = c(0, 2, 3, 4, 1),
  amount = c(1, 2, 3, 3, 2)
)

# Compute Sandvik Severity Index
sandvik_severity_index(example_data$frequency, example_data$amount)
